<h1 class="accent">Disclaimer</h1>
<p>
  I'm old, and I have <strong>bold opinions</strong>. I would love to have a discussion though.
</p>
<p>
  Feel free to interrupt me. <br> If the question is interesting, I will answer it for everyone's benefit. However, be prepared to be asked to wait until the end or continue the discussion off stage. We only have 40 minutes.
</p>
<p>
  If not data-driven, what I say it's an opinion. But also yours :P
