  <blockquote class="fragment">
    Stockholm syndrome is a psychological phenomenon where hostages or individuals who are 
being held captive begin to develop positive feelings towards their captors, such as 
sympathy, trust, and even affection. This can occur despite the fact that they are being 
physically and emotionally abused. <cite>Claude 3.1</cite>
